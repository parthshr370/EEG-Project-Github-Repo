**Understanding the Dataset and Planning for Deep Learning Classification**

---

**1. Dataset Overview**

Your dataset is a comprehensive collection of EEG data recorded from 40 participants during an emotion elicitation experiment. The data includes:

- **EEG Signals**: Raw and processed EEG recordings in various file formats (`.mat`, `.fdt`, `.set`).
- **Behavioral Data**: Participant responses and annotations in `.csv` and `.tsv` files.
- **Metadata**: Information about the recordings and events in `.json` and `.tsv` files.
- **Event Markers**: Timing and labels of events during the EEG recordings.

The dataset is organized into:

- **EEG_Data Folder**: Contains groups of `.mat` files categorized by emotion labels.
- **Raw Data Folder**: Includes behavioral data and subject-specific directories with individual participant data.

**2. Detailed Breakdown of Files**

**A. EEG_Data Folder**

This folder contains EEG data segmented by emotion and organized into groups.

- **Groups (Group-01 to Group-08)**:
    
    Each group represents a set of emotions. For example, Group-01 might contain positive emotions like "Amused," "Happy," and "Joyous." The `.mat` files are named using the format:
    
    ```
    Emotion_SubjectIDTrial-NumberClick-Number-slor.mat
    ```
    
    - **Emotion**: The emotion label (e.g., `Amused`, `Happy`).
    - **SubjectID**: Identifier for each participant (e.g., `mit004`).
    - **Trial Number**: The specific trial during the experiment.
    - **Click Number**: The instance when the participant indicated feeling an emotion.
    - **slor.mat**: MATLAB file containing EEG data around the time of the emotional event.

**Purpose**: These files contain EEG data segments corresponding to specific emotional events, which are crucial for training emotion classification models.

**B. Raw Data Folder**

This folder contains the raw EEG recordings, behavioral data, and event information.

**1. Behavioural Data Folder**

- **.csv Files**: Each file corresponds to a participant and contains their behavioral responses, including self-assessment ratings on scales like Valence, Arousal, Dominance, Liking, Familiarity, and Relevance.
    
    **Purpose**: These ratings provide ground truth labels for the emotional state of the participant during the experiment, which are essential for supervised learning.
    

**2. Subject_Set Folders (Subject_Set-1 to Subject_Set-4)**

These folders organize data by subject, and each subject's folder includes:

- **beh Folder**:
    
    - **sub-SubjectID_task-Emotion_beh.tsv**: Contains detailed behavioral data in tab-separated values format.
        
        **Purpose**: Provides time-stamped behavioral responses aligned with the EEG data, facilitating accurate labeling.
        
- **eeg Folder**:
    
    - **sub-SubjectID_task-Emotion_eeg.set**: EEGlab dataset file that references the `.fdt` file.
    - **sub-SubjectID_task-Emotion_eeg.fdt**: Contains the raw EEG data.
    - **sub-SubjectID_task-emotion_eeg.json**: Metadata about the EEG recording, such as sampling rate, channel names, and electrode positions.
    - **sub-SubjectID_task-emotion_events.tsv**: Event markers with timestamps and labels indicating when stimuli were presented and when participants responded.
    
    **Purpose**: These files collectively represent the complete EEG recording session for each participant, including all necessary metadata and event information for preprocessing and analysis.

**4. Planning Your Execution for Classification**

**Step 1: Data Loading and Organization**

- **Load EEG Data**:
    
    - **Python**:
        
        Use the MNE library to read `.fdt` and `.set` files:
        
        ```python
        import mne
        raw = mne.io.read_raw_eeglab('path_to_set_file.set', preload=True)
        ```
        
    - **MATLAB**:
        
        Use EEGlab to load `.set` files:
        
        ```matlab
        EEG = pop_loadset('filename', 'path_to_set_file.set');
        ```
        
- **Load Behavioral Data**:
    
    - **Python**:
        
        Use pandas to read `.csv` and `.tsv` files:
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        beh_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_csv_or_tsv_file', sep='\t')  # Use sep=',' for .csv files
        ```
        
- **Synchronize Data**:
    
    - Match the EEG data with behavioral responses using timestamps from the event marker files.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

- **Filtering**:
    
    - Apply a band-pass filter (e.g., 0.5â€“45 Hz) to remove noise and artifacts.
        
        ```python
        raw.filter(l_freq=0.5, h_freq=45)
        ```
        
- **Artifact Removal**:
    
    - Use ICA to remove eye blinks and muscle artifacts.
        
        ```python
        ica = mne.preprocessing.ICA(n_components=15, random_state=97)
        ica.fit(raw)
        raw = ica.apply(raw)
        ```
        
- **Re-referencing**:
    
    - Re-reference the EEG data to the average of all channels or a specific reference channel.
        
        ```python
        raw.set_eeg_reference('average')
        ```
        
- **Segmentation**:
    
    - Use event markers to segment the data into epochs around emotional events.
        
        ```python
        events, event_ids = mne.events_from_annotations(raw)
        epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=event_ids, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.8, baseline=(None, 0))
        ```
        

**Step 3: Feature Extraction**

- **Time-Domain Features**:
    
    - Calculate statistical measures like mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Frequency-Domain Features**:
    
    - Perform Fourier Transform to extract power spectral densities in different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma).
        
        ```python
        psd, freqs = mne.time_frequency.psd_welch(epochs)
        ```
        
- **Time-Frequency Analysis**:
    
    - Use wavelet transforms to capture both time and frequency information.
- **Deep Learning Features**:
    
    - **Autoencoders**:
        
        - Learn compressed representations of the EEG data.
    - **LSTM Networks**:
        
        - Capture temporal dependencies in the EEG signals.

**Step 4: Data Preparation for Deep Learning**

- **Label Encoding**:
    
    - Convert emotion labels into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
        le = LabelEncoder()
        labels = le.fit_transform(beh_data['emotion_label'])
        ```
        
- **Data Splitting**:
    
    - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        ```
        
- **Normalization and Scaling**:
    
    - Normalize features to have zero mean and unit variance.
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
        X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
        ```
        

**Step 5: Model Training**

- **Frameworks**:
    
    - Use PyTorch or TensorFlow for building deep learning models.
- **Model Inputs**:
    
    - Ensure the input data shape matches the model requirements (e.g., [batch_size, channels, time_steps]).
- **Training Loop**:
    
    - Define loss functions and optimization algorithms.
        
        ```python
        import torch.nn as nn
        criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        ```
        

**Step 6: Evaluation**

- **Metrics**:
    
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Cross-Validation**:
    
    - Use k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance.
