# Emotion Classification Using DENS EEG Dataset in VAD Space

## Project Pipeline

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an emotion classification system using EEG data from the DENS dataset, focusing on Variance, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) space. The project involves feature extraction using LSTM and autoencoders, model building with Inception v3 and UNIT architectures, optimization techniques, and evaluation using various metrics.

### Prerequisites

- *Libraries*:
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  - [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)
  - [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)

- *File Format*:
  - FDt (Ensure you have the appropriate tools or scripts to read and process FDt files)

### Steps

#### 1. Data Preparation

- *Load the DENS EEG Dataset*:
  - Utilize MNE or custom scripts to read FDt files.
  - Organize the data into a suitable format for processing (e.g., NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors).

- *Preprocessing*:
  - *Filtering*:
    - Apply band-pass filters to remove noise (e.g., 0.5–45 Hz).
  - *Artifact Removal*:
    - Implement techniques like Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to eliminate artifacts (e.g., eye blinks, muscle movements).

- *Regularization and Normalization*:
  - *Normalization*:
    - Standardize the EEG signals across channels and samples.
  - *Regularization*:
    - Apply techniques like dropout or weight decay during model training to prevent overfitting.

#### 2. Feature Extraction

- *Using LSTM and Autoencoders*:

  - *Sequential Approach*:
    1. *Autoencoder*:
       - Train an autoencoder to learn a compressed representation of the EEG data.
       - The encoder part reduces dimensionality, and the decoder reconstructs the input.
    2. *LSTM Network*:
       - Feed the compressed features into an LSTM network.
       - Capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in the EEG signals.

  - *Parallel Approach*:
    - *Simultaneous Processing*:
      - Pass the EEG data through both an autoencoder and an LSTM network independently.
    - *Feature Fusion*:
      - Concatenate or combine the features extracted from both networks.
      - Use combined features for classification.

#### 3. Model Building

- *Inception v3 Architecture*:
  - *Adaptation for EEG Data*:
    - Modify the input layer to accept EEG data shape (e.g., channels × time points).
    - Consider using 1D or 2D convolutions based on data representation.
  - *Transfer Learning*:
    - If applicable, initialize with pre-trained weights on relevant datasets.
  - *Customization*:
    - Adjust the number of classes to match emotion categories in the VAD space.

- *UNIT (Universal Neural Style Transfer) Architecture*:
  - *Integration with Inception v3*:
    - Use UNIT to map EEG features to the VAD space.
    - Combine UNIT with Inception v3 to enhance feature representation.
  - *Implementation*:
    - Ensure compatibility between architectures.
    - Experiment with different fusion strategies.

#### 4. Optimization Techniques

- *Implement Optimization Algorithms*:

  - *Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)*:
    - Use ACO for feature selection to identify the most significant EEG channels or time segments.
    - Implement as a wrapper around model training.

  - *Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)*:
    - Apply GWO for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
    - Integrate GWO into the training loop for dynamic adjustment.

  - *Adam Optimizer*:
    - Utilize Adam as the primary optimizer for training neural networks.
    - Adjust parameters like learning rate, beta1, and beta2 as needed.

  - *Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)*:
    - Employ PSO to optimize network weights or hyperparameters.
    - Can be combined with other optimizers for enhanced performance.

#### 5. Training and Validation

- *Set Up Training Pipeline*:
  - Use PyTorch Lightning for organized and efficient model training.
  - Define loss functions (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss for classification).

- *Data Splitting*:
  - Split data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing).
  - Ensure that splits are stratified based on emotion labels.

- *Cross-Validation*:
  - Implement k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) to evaluate model stability.

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics

- *Confusion Matrix*:
  - Compute confusion matrices to visualize classification performance across classes.

- *F1 Score*:
  - Calculate the F1 score for each class and the overall weighted F1 score.

- *Recall Score*:
  - Evaluate recall to measure the model's ability to identify positive instances.

- *AUC (Area Under the Curve)*:
  - Plot ROC curves and compute AUC for each class.

#### 7. Testing

- *Model Evaluation*:
  - Test the final model on the unseen test set.
  - Report all evaluation metrics on the test data.

- *Statistical Significance*:
  - Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to assess the significance of results.

#### 8. Results and Analysis

- *Performance Analysis*:
  - Compare the performance of different models and optimization techniques.
  - Analyze which features and parameters contribute most to performance.

- *Error Analysis*:
  - Investigate misclassified instances to understand model limitations.

- *Visualization*:
  - Include plots of learning curves, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

#### 9. Documentation and Reporting

- *Code Documentation*:
  - Comment code and provide documentation for functions and classes.

- *Project Report*:
  - Compile a detailed report including methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

- *Reproducibility*:
  - Provide scripts and instructions to reproduce the results.

#### 10. Deployment (Optional)

- *Model Deployment*:
  - Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time emotion recognition.
  - Implement a simple user interface for demonstration purposes.

### Additional Considerations

- *Data Augmentation*:
  - Augment the EEG data by adding noise, shifting signals, or using synthetic data generation techniques.

- *Ethical Considerations*:
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy and ethical guidelines when handling EEG data.

- *Future Work*:
  - Explore other deep learning architectures (e.g., Transformers).
  - Investigate multimodal emotion recognition by integrating EEG with other signals (e.g., facial expressions).
