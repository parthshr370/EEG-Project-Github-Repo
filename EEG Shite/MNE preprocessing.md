To fully incorporate all preprocessing steps for your EEG data in Python using MNE-Python and integrate the guidelines for GPU use (where possible), we can reorganize the given steps while omitting the creation of EOG epochs, as you mentioned there is no EOG channel. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the pipeline accordingly, keeping the operations CPU-bound due to MNE-Python's limitations and focusing on processing efficiency:

### Full Preprocessing Script

```python
import mne
from mne.preprocessing import ICA

# Load the EEG data
file_path = '/path/to/your/eeg_data.set'
raw = mne.io.read_raw_eeglab(file_path, preload=True)

# Display initial info
print("Initial data info:")
print(raw.info)

# Re-reference the data to the average of all electrodes
raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)  # set to 'average' for average referencing
raw.apply_proj()

# Filtering with a fifth-order Butterworth bandpass filter
raw.filter(1., 40., method='iir', iir_params={'order': 5, 'ftype': 'butter'})

# Segmenting the data around emotional events
events, event_id = mne.events_from_annotations(raw)
event_id = {'click': 1}  # update based on your specific annotations and needs
tmin, tmax = -6, 1  # 6s before and 1s after the event
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events=events, event_id=event_id, tmin=tmin, tmax=tmax,
                    baseline=None, preload=True)

# Apply ICA for artifact removal
ica = ICA(n_components=15, random_state=97)
ica.fit(epochs)

# Since there are no EOG channels, you would skip any steps involving eog_epochs
# Manually inspect ICA components
ica.plot_components()  # View ICA components to identify artifacts visually

# Manually select components to exclude based on your inspection
ica.exclude = [0, 1]  # example of excluding components by indices after visual inspection

# Apply the ICA cleaning
epochs_clean = ica.apply(epochs)

# Save the cleaned epochs to a new file, if needed
epochs_clean.save('/path/to/your/cleaned_epochs-epo.fif', overwrite=True)

print("Processing complete. Cleaned data saved.")
```

### Considerations

- **No EOG Channel**: Given there is no EOG channel, you can't use `create_eog_epochs` or `find_bads_eog` directly. Instead, you must rely on visual inspection of the components produced by ICA to identify and exclude those related to artifacts, such as eye movements, blinks, or other physiological artifacts.
- **ICA Component Inspection**: Detailed inspection of ICA components is crucial without specific EOG data. Look for patterns and shapes in the components that typically represent physiological artifacts.
- **Epochs Based on Events**: Ensure that your event markers ('click') are correctly identified in the annotations. The use of epochs focused on these events can help isolate periods of interest for more effective artifact removal.
- **GPU Use**: As explained, MNE does not natively support GPU for computations like ICA. However, consider using libraries like CuPy for custom data manipulations where feasible or necessary, especially if dealing with large datasets where operations like mean computation or standard deviation could be offloaded to the GPU.

This script provides a comprehensive approach to preprocessing your EEG data, focusing on critical steps like re-referencing, filtering, epoching, ICA, and manual intervention for artifact management in the absence of specific EOG channels. Remember, each EEG dataset can have its unique challenges and may require adjustments to this pipeline based on data quality and specific analysis goals.
